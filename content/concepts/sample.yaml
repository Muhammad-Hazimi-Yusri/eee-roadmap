# EEE Concept Domain - Sample Template
#
# This file shows the format for concept domain files in content/concepts/.
# Each domain file groups related concepts by subject area.
#
# Concept IDs (the YAML keys under `concepts:`) are kebab-case and must be
# unique across ALL domain files — the build will error on duplicates.
#
# To add a new domain:
#   1. Create content/concepts/my-domain.yaml following this format
#   2. Run `npm run build:data` — auto-discovered!
#
# JSON Schema: content/concepts/concept.schema.json

_meta:
  domain: my-domain                         # Must match filename (without .yaml)
  description: "A brief description of what this domain covers"

concepts:
  # ── Concept with full fields ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  example-concept:
    name: Example Concept
    tags: [example, fundamentals]           # Optional: for filtering and search
    prerequisites: []                       # Optional: other concept IDs this builds on
    notes: |
      Markdown explanation with **bold**, *italic*, and inline LaTeX: $V = IR$.

      Block equations need blank lines before and after:

      $$P = \frac{V^2}{R}$$

      Supports embedded PDFs: ![Datasheet](/path/to/file.pdf)

  # ── Concept with notes only ───────────────────────────────────────────────
  another-concept:
    name: Another Concept
    notes: |
      A shorter explanation. You can reference other concepts by mentioning
      their name — the glossary auto-linker will pick them up.

  # ── Minimal concept (no notes — displays as a pill only) ─────────────────
  minimal-concept:
    name: Minimal Concept
