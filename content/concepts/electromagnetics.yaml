  characteristic-impedance:
    name: Characteristic impedance
    notes: |
      The ratio of voltage to current for a traveling wave on a transmission line, determined by the line's physical properties.

      $$Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}$$

      Where $L$ is inductance per unit length (H/m) and $C$ is capacitance per unit length (F/m).

      For lossless coaxial cable:

      $$Z_0 = \frac{138}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_r}} \log_{10}\left(\frac{D}{d}\right) \, \Omega$$

      Where $D$ is outer diameter, $d$ is inner conductor diameter, and $\varepsilon_r$ is relative permittivity.

      **Common standard impedances:**
      - **50Ω** - RF systems, test equipment (compromise between power handling and loss)
      - **75Ω** - Video, cable TV (minimum loss for air-dielectric coax)
      - **300Ω** - Twin-lead antenna feedlines
      - **100Ω** - Differential signaling (USB, Ethernet)

  coulombs-law:
    name: Coulomb's law
    notes: |
      Coulomb's Law describes the force between electric charges — the foundation of electrostatics.

      **The Law**

      $$\boxed{F = k\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}}$$

      where:
      - $F$ = force in Newtons (N)
      - $k = 8.99 \times 10^9$ N·m²/C² (Coulomb's constant)
      - $q_1, q_2$ = charges in Coulombs (C)
      - $r$ = distance between charges in meters (m)

      **Alternative form** using permittivity:

      $$F = \frac{q_1 q_2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2}$$

      where $\varepsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12}$ F/m (permittivity of free space)

      **Key Properties**

      - Like charges repel, opposite charges attract
      - Force is along the line connecting the charges
      - Inverse-square relationship: double distance → quarter force
      - Superposition: Total force = vector sum of individual forces

      **Electric Field**

      Force per unit charge:

      $$\mathbf{E} = \frac{\mathbf{F}}{q} = k\frac{Q}{r^2}\hat{r}$$

      Units: Volts per meter (V/m) or Newtons per Coulomb (N/C)

      ![Electric field from positive and negative charges](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/VFPt_charges_plus_minus.svg)

      **Point Charge Field**

      $$E = \frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2}$$

      Field points radially outward from positive charges, inward toward negative.

      **Why this matters for EE**: Electric fields exist between capacitor plates, in semiconductors, and around any charged conductor. Understanding fields helps you understand how components actually work.
  differential-form:
    name: Differential form
    notes: |
      Maxwell's equations in differential form describe fields at a point — useful for deriving wave equations.

      **The Four Equations**

      *Gauss's Law (Electric):*
      $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}$$
      Charges are sources of electric field.

      *Gauss's Law (Magnetic):*
      $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$$
      No magnetic monopoles exist.

      *Faraday's Law:*
      $$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$$
      Changing magnetic field creates electric field.

      *Ampère-Maxwell Law:*
      $$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{J} + \mu_0\varepsilon_0\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$$
      Current and changing electric field create magnetic field.

      **The Operators**

      *Divergence* ($\nabla \cdot$): Measures "outflow" from a point
      $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial z}$$

      *Curl* ($\nabla \times$): Measures "rotation" around a point

      **Maxwell's Key Contribution**

      The displacement current term $\varepsilon_0\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$ was Maxwell's addition. Without it, the equations wouldn't predict electromagnetic waves!
  electric-potential:
    name: Electric potential
    notes: |
      Electric potential is the "voltage landscape" — energy per unit charge at a point.

      **Definition**

      $$V = \frac{U}{q} = -\int \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$$

      Units: Volts (V) = Joules per Coulomb (J/C)

      **Potential from Point Charge**

      $$V = \frac{kQ}{r} = \frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r}$$

      Note: Falls off as $1/r$, not $1/r^2$ like the field.

      **Potential Difference (Voltage)**

      $$V_{ab} = V_a - V_b = -\int_b^a \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$$

      This is what voltmeters measure!

      **Relationship to Electric Field**

      $$\mathbf{E} = -\nabla V = -\frac{dV}{dx}\hat{x} - \frac{dV}{dy}\hat{y} - \frac{dV}{dz}\hat{z}$$

      In 1D: $E = -\frac{dV}{dx}$

      Field points from high to low potential (downhill on the voltage landscape).

      **Equipotential Surfaces**

      ![Equipotential lines around charges](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Equipotential_by_Zureks.png)

      - Lines/surfaces of constant voltage
      - Always perpendicular to electric field lines
      - No work done moving charge along an equipotential

      **Energy Stored**

      Work to move charge $q$ through potential difference $V$:
      $$W = qV$$

      This is why $1 \text{ eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ J (energy gained by electron through 1V).
  faradays-law:
    name: Faraday's law
    notes: |
      Changing magnetic flux induces voltage — the principle behind transformers, generators, and inductors.

      **Faraday's Law**

      $$\boxed{\mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}}$$

      Induced EMF equals the negative rate of change of magnetic flux.

      ![Faraday's EMF experiment](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Faraday_emf_experiment.svg)

      **Magnetic Flux**

      $$\Phi_B = \int \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = BA\cos\theta$$

      Units: Weber (Wb) = T·m²

      **For N-turn Coil**

      $$\mathcal{E} = -N\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$$

      More turns = more voltage!

      **Ways to Change Flux**

      Flux can change by varying:
      1. Magnetic field strength $B$
      2. Area of the loop $A$
      3. Angle between $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{A}$

      **Generator Principle**

      Rotating coil in magnetic field:
      $$\Phi_B = BA\cos(\omega t)$$
      $$\mathcal{E} = NBA\omega\sin(\omega t)$$

      This produces AC voltage!

      **Transformer Principle**

      Changing current in primary creates changing flux:
      $$\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \frac{N_2}{N_1}$$

      Step-up: $N_2 > N_1$, Step-down: $N_2 < N_1$
  gain:
    name: Gain
    notes: |
      **Antenna gain** measures how well an antenna concentrates power in a particular direction compared to a reference.

      $$G = \eta \cdot D$$

      Where $\eta$ is efficiency and $D$ is directivity.

      **Reference antennas:**
      - **dBi**: Gain relative to isotropic radiator
      - **dBd**: Gain relative to half-wave dipole (0 dBd = 2.15 dBi)

      **Directivity**: The ratio of radiation intensity in a given direction to the average over all directions.

      $$D = \frac{4\pi}{\Omega_A}$$

      Where $\Omega_A$ is the beam solid angle in steradians.

      **Typical gains:**
      | Antenna | Gain (dBi) |
      |---------|------------|
      | Isotropic | 0 |
      | Short dipole | 1.76 |
      | Half-wave dipole | 2.15 |
      | Quarter-wave ground plane | 2-3 |
      | 3-element Yagi | 7-8 |
      | 10-element Yagi | 12-14 |
      | 1m dish at 10 GHz | ~30 |

      **Effective aperture**: $A_e = \frac{G \lambda^2}{4\pi}$
  gausss-law:
    name: Gauss's law
    notes: |
      Gauss's Law relates electric flux through a surface to the enclosed charge — powerful for symmetric geometries.

      **The Law**

      $$\boxed{\oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{Q_{enc}}{\varepsilon_0}}$$

      The total electric flux through any closed surface equals the enclosed charge divided by $\varepsilon_0$.

      **Electric Flux**

      $$\Phi_E = \int \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = EA\cos\theta$$

      For uniform field perpendicular to surface: $\Phi_E = EA$

      Units: V·m or N·m²/C

      ![Electric flux through a surface](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Electric-flux-surface-example.svg)

      **Using Gauss's Law**

      1. Identify symmetry (spherical, cylindrical, planar)
      2. Choose Gaussian surface matching the symmetry
      3. On this surface, $E$ is constant and parallel (or perpendicular) to $d\mathbf{A}$
      4. Solve for $E$

      **Common Results**

      *Infinite line charge (λ C/m):*
      $$E = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi\varepsilon_0 r}$$

      *Infinite plane (σ C/m²):*
      $$E = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}$$

      *Spherical shell (outside):*
      $$E = \frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2}$$ (same as point charge!)

      **Key Insight**

      Inside a conductor at equilibrium:
      - $E = 0$ (no field inside)
      - All excess charge resides on the surface
      - Surface is an equipotential

      This is why coaxial cables shield signals and Faraday cages work!
  impedance-mapping:
    name: Impedance mapping
    notes: |
      The Smith chart maps all possible complex impedances onto a unit circle using the reflection coefficient.

      **Normalized impedance:** $z = Z/Z_0 = r + jx$

      The transformation from normalized impedance to reflection coefficient:

      $$\Gamma = \frac{z - 1}{z + 1}$$

      **Reading the chart:**
      - **Center**: $z = 1$ (matched, $\Gamma = 0$)
      - **Right edge**: $z = \infty$ (open circuit, $\Gamma = +1$)
      - **Left edge**: $z = 0$ (short circuit, $\Gamma = -1$)
      - **Upper half**: Inductive (positive reactance)
      - **Lower half**: Capacitive (negative reactance)

      **Constant-R circles**: Pass through the open circuit point (right edge). The $r = 1$ circle passes through the center.

      **Constant-X arcs**: Partial circles tangent to the right edge. Upper half positive (inductive), lower half negative (capacitive).

      ![Smith chart basics](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Smith_chart_gen.svg/400px-Smith_chart_gen.svg.png)
  impedance-matching:
    name: Impedance matching
    notes: |
      **Antenna input impedance** must match the feedline for maximum power transfer.

      **Half-wave dipole:**
      - Resonant impedance: ~73 + j0 Ω (free space)
      - Near ground: Varies with height (20-100 Ω)

      **Quarter-wave monopole over ground plane:**
      - Resonant impedance: ~36 + j0 Ω

      **Impedance varies with:**
      - Frequency (reactive below/above resonance)
      - Element length (longer = inductive, shorter = capacitive)
      - Proximity to ground, other objects
      - Feed point location

      **Common matching techniques:**
      - **Gamma match**: Adjustable for Yagis
      - **Balun**: Balanced to unbalanced (dipole to coax)
      - **Hairpin match**: Shorted stub across feed
      - **Quarter-wave transformer**: Simple narrowband match

      **Bandwidth**: Frequency range where VSWR < 2:1. Thicker elements = wider bandwidth (lower Q).
  inductance:
    name: Inductance
    notes: |
      Inductance quantifies a circuit's opposition to current change — energy stored in magnetic fields.

      **Self-Inductance**

      $$\boxed{v = L\frac{di}{dt}}$$

      where $L$ = inductance in Henrys (H)

      An inductor opposes changes in current by inducing a back-EMF.

      ![Solenoid magnetic field](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg)

      **Energy Stored**

      $$\boxed{E = \frac{1}{2}LI^2}$$

      Energy is stored in the magnetic field, not the wire itself.

      **Inductance of a Solenoid**

      $$L = \frac{\mu_0 N^2 A}{l}$$

      where:
      - $N$ = number of turns
      - $A$ = cross-sectional area
      - $l$ = length

      More turns, larger area = more inductance.

      **Mutual Inductance**

      When flux from one coil links another:
      $$v_2 = M\frac{di_1}{dt}$$

      Coupling coefficient: $k = \frac{M}{\sqrt{L_1 L_2}}$ (0 ≤ k ≤ 1)

      **Inductor Behavior Summary**

      | Condition | Inductor Acts Like |
      |-----------|-------------------|
      | DC steady state | Short circuit ($v = 0$) |
      | High frequency | Open circuit ($Z_L = j\omega L$ large) |
      | Current change | Voltage source opposing change |

      **Practical Note**

      Real inductors have:
      - Wire resistance (series R)
      - Parasitic capacitance (parallel C)
      - Core losses (if magnetic core used)

      These become significant at high frequencies.
  integral-form:
    name: Integral form
    notes: |
      Maxwell's equations in integral form relate fields to charges and currents over regions — often easier to apply.

      **The Four Equations**

      *Gauss's Law (Electric):*
      $$\oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{Q_{enc}}{\varepsilon_0}$$
      Electric flux through closed surface = enclosed charge / ε₀

      *Gauss's Law (Magnetic):*
      $$\oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = 0$$
      Magnetic flux through any closed surface = 0

      *Faraday's Law:*
      $$\oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$$
      EMF around loop = negative rate of change of magnetic flux

      *Ampère-Maxwell Law:*
      $$\oint \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I_{enc} + \mu_0\varepsilon_0\frac{d\Phi_E}{dt}$$
      Magnetic circulation = μ₀ × (conduction + displacement current)

      **Physical Meaning**

      | Equation | What It Says |
      |----------|--------------|
      | Gauss (E) | Charges create diverging E fields |
      | Gauss (B) | B field lines always close on themselves |
      | Faraday | Changing B creates circulating E |
      | Ampère-Maxwell | Current and changing E create circulating B |

      **Connection Between Forms**

      Integral and differential forms are related by:
      - Divergence theorem: $\oint \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \int (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}) dV$
      - Stokes' theorem: $\oint \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \int (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{A}$
  lenzs-law:
    name: Lenz's law
    notes: |
      Lenz's Law determines the direction of induced current — nature opposes change.

      **The Law**

      *The induced current flows in a direction that opposes the change in flux that produced it.*

      This is why there's a negative sign in Faraday's law!

      ![Lenz's law illustration](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Loi_de_Lenz.svg)

      **Applying Lenz's Law**

      1. Determine if flux through loop is increasing or decreasing
      2. Induced current creates a magnetic field to oppose this change
      3. Use right-hand rule to find current direction

      **Examples**

      *Magnet approaching coil (N pole first):*
      - Flux into coil increasing
      - Induced field opposes (points away from magnet)
      - Induced current flows counterclockwise (viewed from magnet)

      *Magnet leaving coil:*
      - Flux decreasing
      - Induced field tries to maintain flux
      - Current reverses direction

      **Energy Conservation**

      Lenz's law is really conservation of energy:
      - If induced current aided the change, you'd get energy from nothing
      - Work must be done against the opposing force

      **Eddy Currents**

      Induced currents in bulk conductors:
      - Cause energy loss (heating)
      - Used for braking (magnetic brakes)
      - Reduced by laminating transformer cores
  magnetic-force:
    name: Magnetic force
    notes: |
      Moving charges experience forces in magnetic fields — the basis for motors and deflection.

      **Force on Moving Charge**

      $$\boxed{\mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}}$$

      Magnitude: $F = qvB\sin\theta$

      where:
      - $q$ = charge (C)
      - $v$ = velocity (m/s)
      - $B$ = magnetic field (Tesla, T)
      - $\theta$ = angle between $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{B}$

      **Key Properties**

      - Force is perpendicular to both velocity and field
      - Stationary charges feel no magnetic force
      - Magnetic force does no work (changes direction, not speed)

      **Right-Hand Rule**

      ![Right-hand rule for magnetic force](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Regla_mano_derecha_Laplace.svg)

      Point fingers in direction of $\mathbf{v}$, curl toward $\mathbf{B}$, thumb points in direction of $\mathbf{F}$ (for positive charge).

      **Force on Current-Carrying Wire**

      $$\mathbf{F} = I\mathbf{L} \times \mathbf{B}$$

      Magnitude: $F = BIL\sin\theta$

      This is how motors work — current in a magnetic field produces force.

      **Magnetic Field Sources**

      *Long straight wire:*
      $$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$$

      *Center of circular loop:*
      $$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2R}$$

      *Inside solenoid:*
      $$B = \mu_0 n I$$

      where $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}$ H/m and $n$ = turns per meter.
  matching:
    name: Matching
    notes: |
      **Impedance matching** eliminates reflections by transforming load impedance to equal source/line impedance.

      **Quarter-wave transformer** - simplest narrowband match:

      $$Z_{match} = \sqrt{Z_0 \cdot Z_L}$$

      A quarter-wavelength section of this impedance transforms $Z_L$ to $Z_0$.

      **L-network** - two reactive elements (L and C) for wideband match:
      - Series element: $X_s = \pm\sqrt{R_L(R_s - R_L)}$
      - Shunt element: $X_p = \pm\frac{R_s R_L}{X_s}$

      **Pi and T networks** - three elements for better bandwidth or specific Q.

      **Stub matching:**
      - Short or open transmission line sections
      - Single stub: distance + stub length
      - Double stub: two stubs at fixed spacing

      **Matching network design process:**
      1. Measure load impedance (VNA)
      2. Plot on Smith chart
      3. Choose topology (L, Pi, T, stub)
      4. Calculate/tune component values
      5. Verify VSWR across bandwidth
  matching-network-design:
    name: Matching network design
    notes: |
      The Smith chart makes matching network design graphical rather than algebraic.

      **Moving on the chart:**
      - **Series element**: Move along constant-R circle
        - Series L: clockwise (add positive reactance)
        - Series C: counter-clockwise (add negative reactance)
      - **Shunt element**: Move along constant-G circle (admittance chart)
        - Shunt C: clockwise on admittance
        - Shunt L: counter-clockwise on admittance

      **L-network design procedure:**
      1. Plot load impedance $Z_L$ (normalized)
      2. Identify if load is inside or outside unity conductance circle
      3. Add series or shunt element to reach unity circle
      4. Add complementary element to reach center

      **Transmission line sections:**
      - Moving along line = rotating around chart center
      - Toward generator: clockwise
      - Toward load: counter-clockwise
      - Full rotation = $\lambda/2$ (half wavelength)

      **Q circles**: Constant Q contours help design for specific bandwidth. Higher Q = narrower bandwidth but sharper selectivity.
  polarization:
    name: Polarization
    notes: |
      The orientation of the electric field vector as the wave propagates.

      **Linear polarization:**
      - **Vertical**: E-field perpendicular to ground (whip antennas, most mobile)
      - **Horizontal**: E-field parallel to ground (TV antennas, HF horizontal dipoles)

      **Circular polarization:**
      - **Right-hand (RHCP)**: E-field rotates clockwise (looking from behind)
      - **Left-hand (LHCP)**: E-field rotates counter-clockwise
      - Used in satellite communications to avoid Faraday rotation issues

      **Polarization mismatch loss:**
      - Same polarization: 0 dB loss
      - Cross-polarized linear: Theoretically infinite loss (practically 20-30 dB)
      - Linear to circular: 3 dB loss
      - Opposite circular: Theoretically infinite loss

      **Axial ratio**: Measure of circular polarization purity. Perfect circular = 0 dB (equal axes). Practical circular antennas aim for < 3 dB.
  radiation-pattern:
    name: Radiation pattern
    notes: |
      A graphical representation of the antenna's radiation intensity as a function of direction.

      **Key pattern features:**
      - **Main lobe**: Direction of maximum radiation
      - **Side lobes**: Secondary maxima (usually unwanted)
      - **Back lobe**: Radiation opposite to main lobe
      - **Null**: Direction of minimum radiation

      **Half-power beamwidth (HPBW)**: Angular width where power drops to half (-3 dB) of maximum.

      **Common patterns:**
      - **Isotropic**: Equal radiation in all directions (theoretical reference)
      - **Omnidirectional**: Equal in azimuth, varies in elevation (dipole, whip)
      - **Directional**: Focused beam (Yagi, dish, horn)

      **Front-to-back ratio (F/B)**: Main lobe to back lobe ratio in dB. Important for rejecting interference from behind.

      ![Antenna radiation pattern](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Sidelobes_en.svg/350px-Sidelobes_en.svg.png)
  reflection-coefficient:
    name: Reflection coefficient
    notes: |
      When a transmission line meets a load impedance different from $Z_0$, part of the wave reflects back.

      $$\Gamma = \frac{Z_L - Z_0}{Z_L + Z_0}$$

      The reflection coefficient $\Gamma$ (gamma) is a complex number:
      - $|\Gamma| = 0$: Perfect match, no reflection
      - $|\Gamma| = 1$: Total reflection (open, short, or pure reactance)

      **Special cases:**
      - Open circuit ($Z_L = \infty$): $\Gamma = +1$
      - Short circuit ($Z_L = 0$): $\Gamma = -1$
      - Matched load ($Z_L = Z_0$): $\Gamma = 0$

      **Power relationships:**
      - Reflected power: $P_r = |\Gamma|^2 \cdot P_i$
      - Transmitted power: $P_t = (1 - |\Gamma|^2) \cdot P_i$

      Called **return loss** in dB: $RL = -20\log_{10}|\Gamma|$

      **Vector Network Analyzers** measure S-parameters and display results on Smith charts.

      **S-parameters (scattering parameters):**
      - $S_{11}$: Input reflection coefficient (return loss)
      - $S_{21}$: Forward transmission (insertion loss/gain)
      - $S_{12}$: Reverse transmission (isolation)
      - $S_{22}$: Output reflection coefficient

      **VNA calibration is critical:**
      - SOL: Short, Open, Load (1-port)
      - SOLT: Short, Open, Load, Thru (2-port)
      - TRL: Thru, Reflect, Line (more accurate)

      **Smith chart on VNA:**
      - Single frequency: one point
      - Frequency sweep: trace showing impedance vs frequency
      - Marker functions: read R, X, VSWR at any point

      **Practical measurements:**
      - Antenna impedance vs frequency
      - Filter response
      - Amplifier input/output match
      - Cable characterization

      A well-matched antenna shows $S_{11}$ trace passing near chart center at operating frequency.

      **Voltage Standing Wave Ratio** - the ratio of maximum to minimum voltage amplitude along a transmission line.

      $$\text{VSWR} = \frac{V_{max}}{V_{min}} = \frac{1 + |\Gamma|}{1 - |\Gamma|}$$

      **VSWR ranges from 1:1 (perfect) to ∞:1 (total mismatch):**

      | VSWR | Return Loss | Reflected Power | Match Quality |
      |------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
      | 1.0:1 | ∞ dB | 0% | Perfect |
      | 1.5:1 | 14 dB | 4% | Excellent |
      | 2.0:1 | 9.5 dB | 11% | Good |
      | 3.0:1 | 6 dB | 25% | Acceptable |
      | 10:1 | 1.7 dB | 67% | Poor |

      Standing waves form because incident and reflected waves interfere. At voltage maxima, currents are minimum (and vice versa).

      **Why VSWR matters:**
      - High VSWR wastes power to reflections
      - Can damage transmitter amplifiers
      - Causes voltage stress on cables/connectors
      - Indicates antenna or matching problems

      Maxwell's equations predict electromagnetic waves — light, radio, WiFi are all the same phenomenon.

      **Derivation Sketch**

      In free space ($\rho = 0$, $\mathbf{J} = 0$):

      Take curl of Faraday's law, substitute Ampère-Maxwell:

      $$\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = \mu_0\varepsilon_0\frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2}$$

      This is the **wave equation**!

      **Speed of Light**

      Comparing to standard wave equation $\nabla^2 f = \frac{1}{v^2}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial t^2}$:

      $$\boxed{c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0\varepsilon_0}} = 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}}$$

      Maxwell calculated this in 1864 — it matched the measured speed of light, proving light is an EM wave!

      **Plane Wave Solution**

      $$\mathbf{E} = E_0\cos(kz - \omega t)\hat{x}$$
      $$\mathbf{B} = B_0\cos(kz - \omega t)\hat{y}$$

      where $k = \omega/c = 2\pi/\lambda$

      **Key Properties**

      - E and B are perpendicular to each other
      - Both perpendicular to direction of propagation (transverse wave)
      - $E_0 = cB_0$
      - In phase, oscillating together

      **The Electromagnetic Spectrum**

      | Type | Frequency | Wavelength |
      |------|-----------|------------|
      | Radio | kHz–GHz | km–cm |
      | Microwave | GHz | cm–mm |
      | Infrared | THz | μm |
      | Visible | ~500 THz | 400–700 nm |
      | X-rays | ~10¹⁸ Hz | nm |

      All travel at $c$ in vacuum — only frequency/wavelength differs!

      **Why This Matters for EE**

      At "low" frequencies, circuits work. At high frequencies (RF, microwave), you must think in terms of waves, transmission lines, and antennas. Maxwell's equations are the bridge.
