  impedance:
    name: Impedance
    notes: |
      Impedance extends Ohm's Law to AC circuits, relating phasor voltage to phasor current.

      $$\boxed{\mathbf{Z} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{I}}}$$

      **Component Impedances**

      | Component | Impedance | Phase |
      |-----------|-----------|-------|
      | Resistor | $Z_R = R$ | 0° (V and I in phase) |
      | Capacitor | $Z_C = \frac{1}{j\omega C} = -\frac{j}{\omega C}$ | −90° (I leads V) |
      | Inductor | $Z_L = j\omega L$ | +90° (V leads I) |

      **Impedance in Rectangular Form**

      $$Z = R + jX$$

      where $R$ = resistance (real part) and $X$ = reactance (imaginary part).

      - $X > 0$: Inductive (current lags)
      - $X < 0$: Capacitive (current leads)

      **Impedance in Polar Form**

      $$Z = |Z|\angle\theta$$

      where $|Z| = \sqrt{R^2 + X^2}$ and $\theta = \arctan(X/R)$

      **Series and Parallel Combinations**

      *Series:* $Z_{total} = Z_1 + Z_2 + Z_3 + ...$

      *Parallel:* $\frac{1}{Z_{total}} = \frac{1}{Z_1} + \frac{1}{Z_2} + ...$

      Same rules as resistors, but with complex arithmetic!
  kvl-and-kcl:
    name: KVL & KCL
    notes: |
      Kirchhoff's Laws are the foundation for analyzing any circuit.

      **Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)**

      *The sum of voltages around any closed loop equals zero.*

      $$\sum V_{loop} = 0$$

      Think of it as conservation of energy: a charge gains and loses energy around a loop, returning to its starting potential.

      ![Kirchhoff's Voltage Law](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Kirchhoff_voltage_law.svg)

      **Sign convention**: 
      - Voltage *rise* (− to +): positive
      - Voltage *drop* (+ to −): negative

      **Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)**

      *The sum of currents entering any node equals zero.*

      $$\sum I_{node} = 0$$

      Think of it as conservation of charge: current in = current out.

      ![Kirchhoff's Current Law](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/KCL_-_Kirchhoff's_circuit_laws.svg)

      **Sign convention**:
      - Current *entering* node: positive
      - Current *leaving* node: negative

      **Example: Simple Loop**

      For a battery ($V_s$) with two resistors ($R_1$, $R_2$) in series:

      KVL: $-V_s + V_1 + V_2 = 0$

      Therefore: $V_s = IR_1 + IR_2 = I(R_1 + R_2)$

      This gives us the series resistance formula: $R_{total} = R_1 + R_2$

      **Practical tip**: Label all currents and voltages with assumed directions first. If you get a negative answer, the actual direction is opposite to your assumption.
  ohms-law:
    name: Ohm's Law
    notes: |
      The fundamental relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.

      $$\boxed{V = IR}$$

      ![Ohm's Law triangle](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Ohm's_law_triangle.svg)

      **The Variables**

      - **V** = Voltage in Volts (V) — the "push" driving current
      - **I** = Current in Amperes (A) — the flow of charge
      - **R** = Resistance in Ohms (Ω) — opposition to current flow

      **Rearranged Forms**

      $$I = \frac{V}{R} \qquad R = \frac{V}{I}$$

      **Power Relations**

      Power can be calculated three ways:
      $$P = IV = I^2R = \frac{V^2}{R}$$

      **Practical Example**

      A 12V battery connected to a 4Ω resistor:
      - Current: $I = 12/4 = 3$ A
      - Power: $P = 12 \times 3 = 36$ W (dissipated as heat)

      **Limitations**

      Ohm's Law assumes:
      - Linear (constant) resistance
      - Temperature doesn't change significantly
      - DC or instantaneous AC values

      Non-ohmic devices (diodes, transistors) don't follow this linear relationship.

  phasors:
    name: Phasors
    notes: |
      Phasors transform sinusoidal time-domain signals into complex numbers, turning calculus into algebra.

      **The Core Idea**

      Any sinusoid $v(t) = V_m\cos(\omega t + \phi)$ can be represented as:

      $$\mathbf{V} = V_m\angle\phi = V_m e^{j\phi}$$

      The phasor captures amplitude ($V_m$) and phase ($\phi$) — frequency ($\omega$) is implicit and must be the same for all phasors in the analysis.

      ![Phasor as rotating vector](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Phasor.svg)

      **Why Phasors Work**

      Euler's formula: $e^{j\omega t} = \cos(\omega t) + j\sin(\omega t)$

      So: $v(t) = \text{Re}\{V_m e^{j\phi} e^{j\omega t}\} = \text{Re}\{\mathbf{V} e^{j\omega t}\}$

      **The Killer Advantage**

      Differentiation becomes multiplication:
      $$\frac{d}{dt} \rightarrow j\omega$$

      Integration becomes division:
      $$\int dt \rightarrow \frac{1}{j\omega}$$

      **Phasor Arithmetic**

      - Addition: Convert to rectangular, add real and imaginary parts
      - Multiplication: Multiply magnitudes, add angles
      - Division: Divide magnitudes, subtract angles

      **Converting Back to Time Domain**

      From phasor $\mathbf{V} = V_m\angle\phi$:
      $$v(t) = V_m\cos(\omega t + \phi)$$

      Remember to include $\omega$ which was "hidden" during phasor analysis.
  resonance:
    name: Resonance
    notes: |
      Resonance occurs when inductive and capacitive reactances cancel — circuits exhibit maximum or minimum impedance.

      **Series RLC Resonance**

      At resonance: $X_L = X_C$

      $$\omega_0 L = \frac{1}{\omega_0 C}$$

      Solving: $\boxed{f_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}}$

      At resonance:
      - Impedance is minimum ($Z = R$)
      - Current is maximum
      - Voltage across L and C can exceed source voltage!

      **Parallel RLC Resonance**

      At resonance:
      - Impedance is maximum
      - Current from source is minimum
      - Current circulates between L and C

      ![Resonant frequency amplitude](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Resonant_frequency_amplitude.svg)

      **Quality Factor (Q)**

      $$Q = \frac{f_0}{\Delta f} = \frac{\omega_0 L}{R} = \frac{1}{\omega_0 CR}$$

      Higher Q means:
      - Sharper resonance peak
      - Narrower bandwidth
      - More frequency selective

      **Bandwidth**

      $$BW = \frac{f_0}{Q}$$

      The range of frequencies where response is within 3dB of peak.

      **Applications**

      - Radio tuning circuits (select one station)
      - Filters (bandpass, notch)
      - Oscillators
  thevenin-and-norton:
    name: Thevenin & Norton
    notes: |
      These theorems let you simplify complex networks into simple equivalents.

      **Thevenin's Theorem**

      Any linear circuit with two terminals can be replaced by:
      - A voltage source $V_{th}$ in series with
      - A resistance $R_{th}$

      ![Thevenin equivalent circuit](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Thevenin_equivalent_circuit.svg)

      **Norton's Theorem**

      Same circuit can also be replaced by:
      - A current source $I_N$ in parallel with
      - A resistance $R_N$

      **The Equivalence**

      $$V_{th} = I_N \cdot R_N \qquad I_N = \frac{V_{th}}{R_{th}} \qquad R_{th} = R_N$$

      **Finding Thevenin Equivalent — Step by Step**

      1. **Remove the load** from terminals A-B
      2. **Find $V_{th}$**: Calculate open-circuit voltage between A-B
      3. **Find $R_{th}$**: Either:
         - Deactivate sources (V→short, I→open) and find equivalent R, or
         - Use $R_{th} = V_{OC}/I_{SC}$
      4. **Draw equivalent**: $V_{th}$ in series with $R_{th}$

      **Maximum Power Transfer**

      Power to load is maximized when:
      $$R_{load} = R_{th}$$

      Maximum power delivered:
      $$P_{max} = \frac{V_{th}^2}{4R_{th}}$$

      **Why this matters**: Thevenin equivalents simplify analysis when you need to test different loads on the same circuit — you only solve the complex part once.
