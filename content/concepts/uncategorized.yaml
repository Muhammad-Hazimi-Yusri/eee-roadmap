    notes: |
      **Analog modulation** - varying carrier properties in proportion to message signal.

      **Amplitude Modulation (AM):**

      $$s(t) = A_c[1 + m \cdot x(t)]\cos(2\pi f_c t)$$

      Where $m$ is modulation index (keep $m \leq 1$ to avoid overmodulation).

      - **Bandwidth**: $BW = 2f_m$ (twice the message bandwidth)
      - **Efficiency**: Only 1/3 of power carries information (carrier + two sidebands)
      - **DSB-SC**: Suppressed carrier, more efficient but needs synchronous detection
      - **SSB**: Single sideband, half bandwidth, used in HF radio

      **Frequency Modulation (FM):**

      $$s(t) = A_c \cos\left(2\pi f_c t + 2\pi k_f \int x(\tau)d\tau\right)$$

      - **Deviation**: $\Delta f = k_f \cdot \max|x(t)|$
      - **Modulation index**: $\beta = \Delta f / f_m$
      - **Bandwidth** (Carson's rule): $BW \approx 2(\Delta f + f_m) = 2f_m(\beta + 1)$

      **FM advantages**: Noise immunity (capture effect), constant envelope (efficient amplifiers). **Disadvantage**: Wider bandwidth than AM.

    notes: |
      **Digital modulation** - discrete symbols representing bits.

      **ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying):**
      - Binary: Two amplitude levels (OOK is special case with 0 and 1)
      - Simple but susceptible to noise and fading
      - $BW \approx 2R_b$ for binary ASK

      **FSK (Frequency Shift Keying):**

      $$s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_i t)$$

      Where $f_i$ switches between frequencies for each symbol.

      - More robust to amplitude noise than ASK
      - $BW \approx 2\Delta f + 2R_b$ (wider than ASK)
      - Used in low-rate applications (pagers, RFID, LoRa)

      **PSK (Phase Shift Keying):**

      $$s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t + \phi_i)$$

      - **BPSK**: 2 phases (0°, 180°), 1 bit/symbol, best noise immunity
      - **QPSK**: 4 phases (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°), 2 bits/symbol
      - **8-PSK**: 8 phases, 3 bits/symbol

      **Bit Error Rate (BER)** for BPSK in AWGN:

      $$P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}}\right)$$

      ![PSK constellation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/QPSK_Gray_Coded.svg/200px-QPSK_Gray_Coded.svg.png)
  bandwidth-efficiency:
    name: Bandwidth efficiency
    notes: |
      **Spectral efficiency** measures how many bits per second fit in each Hz of bandwidth.

      $$\eta = \frac{R_b}{BW} \quad \text{[bits/s/Hz]}$$

      **Nyquist limit** for ISI-free transmission:

      $$R_s \leq 2BW$$

      Maximum symbol rate is twice the bandwidth. With M-ary modulation ($\log_2 M$ bits/symbol):

      $$\eta_{max} = 2\log_2 M \quad \text{bits/s/Hz}$$

      **Practical spectral efficiencies:**
      | Scheme | Efficiency |
      |--------|------------|
      | BPSK | 1 bit/s/Hz |
      | QPSK | 2 bits/s/Hz |
      | 16-QAM | 4 bits/s/Hz |
      | 64-QAM | 6 bits/s/Hz |

      **Shannon capacity** - theoretical maximum:

      $$C = BW \cdot \log_2\left(1 + \frac{S}{N}\right)$$

      No modulation scheme can exceed this. Modern codes (LDPC, Turbo) approach within 1 dB.

      **OFDM**: Divides bandwidth into many narrow subcarriers, each carrying low-rate QAM. Approaches Nyquist limit with guard intervals for multipath.
  crc:
    name: CRC
    notes: |
      **Cyclic Redundancy Check** - polynomial division for error detection.

      Treat data as coefficients of a polynomial, divide by generator polynomial, append remainder.

      **CRC calculation:**
      1. Append $n$ zeros to message (where $n$ = generator degree)
      2. Divide by generator using XOR (no carries)
      3. Remainder = CRC checksum
      4. Transmit: message + CRC

      **Example with CRC-3 (generator $x^3 + x + 1$ = `1011`):**
      ```
      Message: 11010011101100
      Generator: 1011

      After XOR division, remainder = CRC
      ```

      **Common CRC polynomials:**
      | Name | Polynomial | Bits | Used In |
      |------|-----------|------|---------|
      | CRC-8 | $x^8+x^2+x+1$ | 8 | I²C, 1-Wire |
      | CRC-16 | $x^{16}+x^{15}+x^2+1$ | 16 | Modbus, USB |
      | CRC-32 | (complex) | 32 | Ethernet, ZIP |

      **Properties:**
      - Detects all single-bit errors
      - Detects all burst errors ≤ n bits
      - Detects most longer burst errors
      - Does NOT correct errors

      Hardware implementation: Simple shift register with XOR feedback.

      ## Design Rules (DRC)

      Design rules ensure your PCB can actually be manufactured.
      Every fab has minimum capabilities — violate them and your
      board fails or costs extra.

      ### Critical Parameters

      | Parameter | Typical Minimum | Description |
      |-----------|-----------------|-------------|
      | Trace width | 6-8 mil | Narrowest copper |
      | Trace spacing | 6-8 mil | Gap between copper |
      | Via drill | 10-12 mil | Hole diameter |
      | Via annular ring | 5-8 mil | Copper around hole |
      | Solder mask dam | 4 mil | Mask between pads |
      | Silkscreen width | 5-6 mil | Text/line minimum |

      1 mil = 0.001 inch = 0.0254 mm

      ### Clearances
      Clearances prevent shorts and manufacturing issues:
      ```
      ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
      │  Trace ══════  ║spacing║  ══════ Trace  │
      │                                     │
      │  Pad ●────── annular ring ──────● Via │
      │                                     │
      │  Board edge ├── edge clearance ──┤   │
      └─────────────────────────────────────┘
      ```

      - **Trace-to-trace**: Prevent shorts
      - **Trace-to-pad**: Manufacturing tolerance
      - **Pad-to-pad**: Solder bridging prevention
      - **Edge clearance**: Routing/panelization

      ### High Voltage Considerations

      For voltages >50V, spacing must increase:

      $$\text{Spacing (mm)} \approx 0.1 + \frac{V_{peak}}{500}$$

      Consult IPC-2221 for proper clearances.

      ### DRC Setup

      Configure rules in your EDA tool before layout:
      ```
      Minimum trace width:     0.2mm (8 mil)
      Minimum clearance:       0.2mm (8 mil)
      Minimum via drill:       0.3mm (12 mil)
      Minimum annular ring:    0.15mm (6 mil)
      Board edge clearance:    0.5mm (20 mil)
      ```

      ### Manufacturer Capabilities

      Check your fab's specs! Example (JLCPCB standard):

      | Parameter | Standard | Advanced |
      |-----------|----------|----------|
      | Min trace/space | 5/5 mil | 3.5/3.5 mil |
      | Min via drill | 0.3mm | 0.2mm |
      | Min hole size | 0.3mm | 0.15mm |

      Advanced capabilities cost more. Design to standard rules when possible.

      ### Running DRC

      1. Set rules matching your manufacturer
      2. Run DRC before generating Gerbers
      3. Fix all errors (yellow = warning, red = error)
      4. Re-run until clean
      5. Document any intentional rule violations

      See TI application notes for advanced guidelines:

      - [High Speed Layout](https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/scaa082)
  fading:
    name: Fading
    notes: |
      **Fading** - signal strength variations due to multipath propagation and mobility.

      **Large-scale fading (shadowing):**
      - Caused by obstacles blocking/absorbing signal
      - Log-normal distribution (dB values are Gaussian)
      - Varies over distances of 10s-100s of wavelengths

      **Small-scale fading (multipath):**
      - Multiple signal paths with different delays/phases
      - Constructive/destructive interference
      - Varies over fractions of a wavelength

      **Rayleigh fading**: No line-of-sight, many scattered paths. Deep fades (20-30 dB) occur frequently.

      $$p(r) = \frac{r}{\sigma^2}e^{-r^2/2\sigma^2}$$

      **Rician fading**: Strong line-of-sight plus scattered paths. Less severe fading than Rayleigh.

      **Combating fading:**
      - **Diversity**: Multiple antennas, frequencies, or time slots
      - **OFDM**: Spreads data across frequencies
      - **Equalization**: Compensates for channel distortion
      - **Interleaving**: Spreads burst errors across time
      - **Fade margin**: Extra link budget allowance

  gerbers:
    name: Gerbers
    notes: |
      ## Gerber Files

      Gerbers are the universal language of PCB fabrication — every manufacturer
      accepts them. They describe each layer as 2D artwork.

      ### Standard File Set

      | Extension | Layer | Description |
      |-----------|-------|-------------|
      | .GTL | Top Copper | Signal traces, pads |
      | .GBL | Bottom Copper | Signal traces, pads |
      | .GTS | Top Solder Mask | Green coating openings |
      | .GBS | Bottom Solder Mask | Green coating openings |
      | .GTO | Top Silkscreen | Component labels |
      | .GBO | Bottom Silkscreen | Component labels |
      | .GTP | Top Paste | Stencil for solder paste |
      | .GBP | Bottom Paste | Stencil for solder paste |
      | .GKO / .GM1 | Board Outline | Mechanical boundary |
      | .DRL | Drill File | Hole locations (Excellon format) |

      ### Gerber Format

      **RS-274X** (extended Gerber) is the modern standard:
      - Embedded aperture definitions
      - Self-contained files
      - ASCII format (human-readable)

      ### Generation Workflow

      1. Run final DRC check
      2. Generate Gerbers (plot each layer)
      3. Generate drill file (Excellon format)
      4. **Review in Gerber viewer** (critical step!)
      5. Zip all files together
      6. Upload to manufacturer

      ### Gerber Viewers

      Always verify before ordering:
      - **KiCad GerbView** (built-in)
      - **gerbv** (free, open-source)
      - **Online viewers** (OSH Park, JLCPCB)

      ### Common Mistakes

      - Missing drill file
      - Wrong board outline layer
      - Solder mask inverted (shows mask, not openings)
      - Missing paste layer for SMD assembly
      - Different units (mm vs inches) between files

      ### Manufacturer Upload

      Most fabs (JLCPCB, PCBWay, OSH Park) auto-detect layers
      from standard extensions. Review their preview before ordering!
  hamming-code:
    name: Hamming code
    notes: |
      **Hamming codes** - can detect AND correct single-bit errors using strategically placed parity bits.

      **Hamming(7,4)**: 4 data bits + 3 parity bits = 7 total bits

      Parity bit positions: Powers of 2 (positions 1, 2, 4)
      Data bit positions: Everything else (3, 5, 6, 7)

      **Parity coverage:**
      - $p_1$ (pos 1): checks positions with bit 0 set in binary (1,3,5,7)
      - $p_2$ (pos 2): checks positions with bit 1 set (2,3,6,7)
      - $p_4$ (pos 4): checks positions with bit 2 set (4,5,6,7)

      **Decoding:**
      1. Recalculate each parity
      2. Form syndrome from parity check results
      3. Syndrome value = position of error (0 = no error)

      **Code rate**: $R = k/n = 4/7 \approx 0.57$

      **Hamming distance**: Minimum bits different between valid codewords.
      - Hamming(7,4) has distance 3
      - Can detect 2-bit errors OR correct 1-bit error

      **SECDED** (Single Error Correct, Double Error Detect): Add overall parity bit → Hamming(8,4) detects 2-bit errors.
  layout:
    name: Layout
    notes: |
      ## PCB Layout

      Layout transforms your schematic into physical reality — component placement,
      copper traces, and layer stackup.

      ### Layout Workflow

      1. **Import netlist** from schematic
      2. **Define board outline**
      3. **Place components** (critical components first)
      4. **Route traces** (connect the nets)
      5. **Pour ground planes**
      6. **Run DRC** (Design Rules Check)
      7. **Generate manufacturing files**

      ### Layer Stackup

      | Layers | Typical Configuration |
      |--------|----------------------|
      | 2-layer | Top: Signals + Power / Bottom: GND + Signals |
      | 4-layer | Signal → GND → Power → Signal |
      | 6-layer | Sig → GND → Sig → Sig → Power → Sig |

      Two-layer is cheapest and sufficient for most hobby/simple projects.
      Four-layer adds solid reference planes for better signal integrity.

      ### Placement Guidelines

      1. **Connectors** at board edges
      2. **Decoupling caps** close to IC power pins
      3. **Crystal/oscillator** close to MCU
      4. **High-frequency** components near their sources
      5. **Thermal** considerations (hot components away from sensitive ones)
      6. **Mechanical** constraints (mounting holes, keep-outs)

      ### Routing Guidelines

      - **Shortest path** (but not at expense of other rules)
      - **Avoid 90° corners** (use 45° or curves)
      - **Match trace lengths** for high-speed differential pairs
      - **Keep analog/digital separate**
      - **Don't route under noisy components**

      ### Trace Width

      Width determines current capacity:

      | Width (1oz Cu) | ~Current (10°C rise) |
      |----------------|---------------------|
      | 10 mil | 300 mA |
      | 20 mil | 800 mA |
      | 50 mil | 1.5 A |
      | 100 mil | 3 A |

      Use online calculators for precise values based on your stackup.

      ### Ground Planes

      Pour copper fills connected to GND:
      - Low impedance return path
      - EMI shielding
      - Heat dissipation

      See [SparkFun PCB Basics](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pcb-basics/all)
      and [SparkFun EAGLE Layout](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-eagle-board-layout/all).
  link-budget:
    name: Link budget
    notes: |
      **Link budget** - accounting of all gains and losses from transmitter to receiver.

      $$P_{rx} = P_{tx} + G_{tx} - L_{tx} - L_{path} - L_{misc} + G_{rx} - L_{rx}$$

      All values in dB/dBm. Must have $P_{rx} >$ receiver sensitivity with margin.

      **Typical link budget components:**

      | Parameter | Typical Values |
      |-----------|---------------|
      | $P_{tx}$ (transmit power) | 0-30 dBm |
      | $G_{tx}$ (antenna gain) | 2-40 dBi |
      | $L_{tx}$ (cable/connector loss) | 1-3 dB |
      | $L_{path}$ (path loss) | 60-150 dB |
      | $L_{misc}$ (fade margin, body loss) | 10-30 dB |
      | $G_{rx}$ (receive antenna) | 0-20 dBi |
      | $L_{rx}$ (receiver losses) | 1-3 dB |

      **Link margin**: How much $P_{rx}$ exceeds sensitivity.
      - 10-20 dB margin typical for reliable links
      - Accounts for fading, interference, aging

      **Example (WiFi):**
      - TX power: 20 dBm
      - TX antenna: 3 dBi
      - Path loss (30m indoor): -70 dB
      - RX antenna: 3 dBi
      - Received: 20 + 3 - 70 + 3 = **-44 dBm**
      - Sensitivity (-80 dBm): **36 dB margin** ✓
  parity:
    name: Parity
    notes: |
      **Parity bits** - simplest error detection by adding redundancy.

      **Even parity**: Add bit so total number of 1s is even.
      **Odd parity**: Add bit so total number of 1s is odd.

      Example (even parity):
      - Data: `1010110` → Parity: `1` → Transmitted: `10101101`
      - Receiver counts 1s: if odd, error detected

      **Limitations:**
      - Detects single-bit errors only
      - Cannot detect even number of bit errors
      - Cannot correct errors (only detect)
      - Cannot identify which bit is wrong

      **2D parity** (block check):
      - Arrange data in rows and columns
      - Add parity for each row AND each column
      - Can detect more errors, even locate single-bit errors
      Example (2D parity):
      ```
      Data:    Parity:
      1 0 1 1  | 1
      0 1 1 0  | 0
      1 1 0 1  | 1
      --------+--
      0 0 0 0    0
      ```

      Used in: UART, simple memory systems, ASCII (7 data + 1 parity).
  path-loss:
    name: Path loss
    notes: |
      **Path loss** - signal attenuation between transmitter and receiver.

      **Free Space Path Loss (FSPL):**

      $$L_{fs} = 20\log_{10}(d) + 20\log_{10}(f) + 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{4\pi}{c}\right)$$

      Simplified (d in km, f in MHz):

      $$L_{fs} = 32.4 + 20\log_{10}(f_{MHz}) + 20\log_{10}(d_{km})$$

      **Key insight**: Path loss increases 6 dB per doubling of distance (inverse square law) and 6 dB per doubling of frequency.

      **Real-world models add obstacles:**

      | Environment | Path Loss Exponent $n$ |
      |-------------|----------------------|
      | Free space | 2 |
      | Urban cellular | 3.5-4.5 |
      | Indoor (same floor) | 2-3 |
      | Indoor (through floors) | 4-6 |

      $$L = L_0 + 10n\log_{10}\left(\frac{d}{d_0}\right)$$

      **Common models:**
      - Hata model (urban/suburban cellular)
      - COST-231 (extends Hata to higher frequencies)
      - ITU indoor model
  qam:
    name: QAM
    notes: |
      **Quadrature Amplitude Modulation** - combines amplitude and phase modulation for high spectral efficiency.

      $$s(t) = I(t)\cos(2\pi f_c t) - Q(t)\sin(2\pi f_c t)$$

      Where $I(t)$ and $Q(t)$ are in-phase and quadrature baseband signals.

      **Constellation diagrams:**
      - **16-QAM**: 4×4 grid, 4 bits/symbol
      - **64-QAM**: 8×8 grid, 6 bits/symbol
      - **256-QAM**: 16×16 grid, 8 bits/symbol

      **Trade-offs:**
      | Modulation | Bits/Symbol | Relative SNR Required |
      |------------|-------------|----------------------|
      | QPSK | 2 | 0 dB (reference) |
      | 16-QAM | 4 | +4 dB |
      | 64-QAM | 6 | +8 dB |
      | 256-QAM | 8 | +12 dB |

      Higher-order QAM: More bits/symbol but points closer together → more susceptible to noise.

      **Adaptive modulation**: Modern systems (WiFi, LTE) switch QAM order based on channel conditions. Good SNR → 256-QAM. Poor SNR → QPSK.

      ![16-QAM constellation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/QAM16_Demonstration.gif/220px-QAM16_Demonstration.gif)
  rssi:
    name: RSSI
    notes: |
      **Received Signal Strength Indicator** - measure of power in a received radio signal.

      **Units and ranges:**
      - dBm (absolute power): Typical WiFi -30 to -90 dBm
      - RSSI (arbitrary units): Vendor-specific scaling
      - Often 0-255 or 0-100 range mapped to dBm

      **Typical signal quality (WiFi):**
      | RSSI (dBm) | Quality | Typical Use |
      |------------|---------|-------------|
      | > -50 | Excellent | High throughput |
      | -50 to -60 | Good | Video streaming |
      | -60 to -70 | Fair | Web browsing |
      | -70 to -80 | Weak | Basic connectivity |
      | < -80 | Poor | Unreliable |

      **RSSI applications:**
      - **Roaming decisions**: Mobile devices switch APs
      - **Rate adaptation**: Higher RSSI → faster modulation
      - **Location**: Fingerprinting, trilateration
      - **Diagnostics**: Site surveys, troubleshooting

      **Limitations:**
      - Doesn't account for interference (use SNR instead)
      - Varies between vendors/chipsets
      - Affected by antenna orientation, body blocking

      **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** is more meaningful:
      $$SNR = RSSI - Noise Floor$$

      Noise floor typically -90 to -100 dBm in WiFi bands.

      ## Schematic Capture

      The schematic is your circuit's logical blueprint — components and their
      connections without physical placement concerns.

      ![Electrical Symbols](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Electrical_symbols_library.svg)

      ### Schematic Workflow

      1. **Add components** from libraries (or create custom symbols)
      2. **Place and arrange** logically (inputs left, outputs right)
      3. **Wire connections** (nets)
      4. **Add power symbols** (VCC, GND)
      5. **Annotate** (assign reference designators: R1, C1, U1)
      6. **Run ERC** (Electrical Rules Check)

      | Element | Purpose |
      |---------|---------|
      | Symbol | Graphical representation |
      | Reference | R1, C1, U1 (unique ID) |
      | Value | 10kΩ, 100nF, ATmega328P |
      | Footprint | Physical package link |
      | Pins | Connection points with names/numbers |

      ### Best Practices

      - **Signal flow**: Left-to-right, top-to-bottom
      - **Group by function**: Power, digital, analog sections
      - **Label nets**: Named nets are clearer than lines everywhere
      - **Use hierarchical sheets** for complex designs
      - **Add notes**: Document non-obvious design decisions

      ### Power Symbols

      ![Battery Symbols](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Battery_symbols_and_circuit.svg)

      Use global power symbols (VCC, +3V3, GND) rather than wiring
      power to every component — cleaner schematics.

      ### ERC (Electrical Rules Check)

      Catches common errors:
      - Unconnected pins
      - Multiple outputs driving same net
      - Power pins not connected
      - Input pins floating

    name: Shannon limit
    notes: |
      **Shannon's Channel Capacity Theorem** (1948) - the fundamental limit of reliable communication.

      $$C = BW \cdot \log_2\left(1 + \frac{S}{N}\right) \quad \text{[bits/second]}$$

      Where:
      - $C$ = channel capacity
      - $BW$ = bandwidth in Hz
      - $S/N$ = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not dB)

      **Key insights:**
      - Below capacity: Error-free transmission is theoretically possible
      - Above capacity: Errors are unavoidable regardless of coding
      - Approaching capacity requires increasingly complex codes

      **Shannon limit in $E_b/N_0$:**

      $$\frac{E_b}{N_0} > \frac{2^{R/BW} - 1}{R/BW}$$

      At capacity: $E_b/N_0 = -1.59$ dB (theoretical minimum for any rate)

      **Modern codes approaching Shannon limit:**
      - Turbo codes (1993): Within 0.5 dB
      - LDPC codes: Within 0.1 dB
      - Polar codes: Provably achieve capacity

      Shannon's theorem tells us WHAT is possible, not HOW. Finding practical codes that approach capacity took 50+ years.
