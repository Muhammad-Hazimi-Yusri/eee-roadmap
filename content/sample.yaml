# EEE Roadmap - Sample Template
#
# This is a template for creating your own roadmap track.
# Copy this file to content/tracks/ and rename it (e.g., my-track.yaml).
# Tracks in content/tracks/ use the concept library (ref: syntax).
# Tracks in content/ (legacy) use inline concepts — both formats work.
#
# NOTE: This file is excluded from the build process.

# Metadata (all fields optional)
meta:
  title: My Track Title           # Default: derived from filename
  description: >-
    A brief description of what this track covers.
