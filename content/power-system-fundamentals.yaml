          Foundation concepts for understanding power system structure. Covers 
          the building blocks of power networks: nodes as connection points, 
          branches as circuit elements, and busbars as central distribution points.

          - fundamentals/ac-circuits/AC Circuit Analysis
          - Complex numbers (phasors)
        outcomes:
          - Identify nodes, branches, and loops in power network diagrams

              In power systems, each node has:
              - Voltage magnitude $|V|$
              - Voltage angle $\theta$

          Understanding when to use radial (simple/cheap), ring (reliable), 
          or mesh (redundant) topologies for different applications.
        prerequisites:

              Can be operated as:
              - **Open ring:** One point normally open (like two radials)
              - **Closed ring:** Full loop energized (better reliability)
              
              **Use:** Urban distribution, commercial areas
          - name: Mesh Topology

          Why power systems use different voltage levels and how transformers 
          enable efficient power transfer. Understanding the hierarchy from 
          generation through transmission to distribution.
        prerequisites:
          - power-system-fundamentals/power-factor/Power Factor
        outcomes:
          - Identify voltage level classifications and their applications
          - Explain rationale for voltage transformation

        outcomes:
          - Select appropriate base values for power system analysis

              - Equipment values fall in narrow range (0.05-0.15 pu)

              $$Z_{base} = \frac{11^2}{100} = 1.21 \text{ Ω}$$
              
              $$Z_{pu} = \frac{10}{1.21} = 8.26 \text{ pu}$$
          - name: Change of Base
            notes: |
              Converting between different bases:
