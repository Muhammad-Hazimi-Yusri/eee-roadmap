        title: Newton-Raphson and Gauss-Seidel Methods
        description: >-
          The two main iterative algorithms for solving load flow equations. 
          Gauss-Seidel is simpler but slower; Newton-Raphson is the industry 
          standard for its speed and robustness.
        prerequisites:
          - power-system-fundamentals/load-flow-fundamentals/What is Load Flow Analysis
        outcomes:
          - Explain conceptual differences between G-S and N-R methods
          - Understand why N-R is preferred for large systems
          - Interpret convergence behavior and potential issues

          - name: Why Iterative?
            notes: |
              Load flow equations are **nonlinear** (power = V × I, but I depends on V).
              
              No closed-form solution exists for networks with more than a few buses.
              
              Must iterate: guess → calculate → refine → repeat until converged.
          - name: Gauss-Seidel Method
            notes: |
              Sequential update of each bus voltage:
              
              $$V_i^{(k+1)} = \frac{1}{Y_{ii}} \left[ \frac{P_i - jQ_i}{V_i^{(k)*}} - \sum_{j \neq i} Y_{ij} V_j^{(k)} \right]$$
              
              **Pros:** Simple to understand and code
              
              **Cons:** Slow (100+ iterations), poor convergence for large/meshed networks
              
              **Use:** Small systems, educational purposes
          - name: Newton-Raphson Method
            notes: |
              Solves power mismatch equations using Jacobian matrix:
              
              $$\begin{bmatrix} \Delta P \\ \Delta Q \end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{J} \begin{bmatrix} \Delta \theta \\ \Delta V \end{bmatrix}$$
              
              **Jacobian structure:**
              
              $$\mathbf{J} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial P}{\partial \theta} & \frac{\partial P}{\partial V} \\ \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \theta} & \frac{\partial Q}{\partial V} \end{bmatrix}$$
              
              **Pros:** Fast (3-5 iterations), robust, industry standard
              
              **Cons:** More complex, requires Jacobian calculation

              - **Q-V:** Reactive power strongly coupled to voltages
              
              Solves two smaller systems instead of one large one. Even faster for transmission networks.

            notes: |
              **Converged:** Mismatches below tolerance (typically 0.001 pu)
              
              **Divergence causes:**
              - Poor initial guess (use flat start: V=1.0, θ=0)

            notes: |
              Plot of voltage magnitude across buses, typically ordered by electrical distance from source.
              
              **Acceptable range:** Usually 0.95 - 1.05 pu (±5%)
              
              **Violations indicate:**
              - Heavy loading (voltage drop)
              - Insufficient reactive support
              - Need for tap changer adjustment or capacitor banks

              Power flow as percentage of thermal rating:
              
              $$\text{Loading} = \frac{|S_{flow}|}{S_{rating}} \times 100\%$$
              
              **Watch for:**
              - \>80% - approaching limit, monitor closely
              - \>100% - overloaded, requires action
              
              Heavily loaded lines are **bottlenecks** limiting power transfer.

              **Typical values:** 2-8% of total generation
              
              **Loss breakdown:**
              - Transmission: ~2-3%
              - Distribution: ~4-6%
              
              High losses indicate inefficient power flow paths.

              Maximum power (MVA) or current (kA) that flows during a fault at a given point.
              
              **Two expressions:**
              
              $$\text{Fault MVA} = \frac{S_{base}}{Z_{pu}}$$

          - name: Per-Unit Method
            notes: |
              For three-phase fault at a bus:
              
              $$I_f (pu) = \frac{V_{pre-fault}}{Z_{total}}$$
              
              Usually assume $V_{pre-fault} = 1.0$ pu.
              
              **Example:** If total impedance to fault = 0.1 pu:
              
              $$I_f = \frac{1.0}{0.1} = 10 \text{ pu}$$

              - Grid infeed: 500 MVA
              - Transformer: 10% on 20 MVA base → $\frac{20}{0.1} = 200$ MVA
              
              $$\frac{1}{MVA_f} = \frac{1}{500} + \frac{1}{200}$$

              - Affects peak asymmetrical current
              - Higher X/R → slower decay → higher peak
              
              **Typical values:**
              - Transmission: X/R = 15-30
              - Distribution: X/R = 5-15
              - LV systems: X/R = 2-5

          - name: Equipment Rating
            notes: |
              All equipment must withstand fault conditions:
              
              | Equipment | Fault Rating Needed |
              |-----------|-------------------|
              | Circuit breakers | Breaking & making capacity |
              | Busbars | Short-time withstand (1-3 sec) |
              | Cables | Short-circuit rating |
              | CTs | Thermal & dynamic limits |
              
              **Under-rated equipment** can fail catastrophically during faults.

            notes: |
              Relay settings require accurate fault currents:
              
              - **Pick-up settings:** Must detect minimum fault current
              - **Time grading:** Based on fault magnitude variation
              - **Reach settings:** Distance relays need accurate impedances
              
              Wrong fault data = wrong protection = nuisance trips or failure to operate.
          - name: Arc Flash Safety
            notes: |
              Arc flash energy proportional to fault current and duration:
              
              $$E = I^{1.081} \times t \times k$$
              
              Higher fault level → higher incident energy → more PPE required.
              
              **IEEE 1584** standard requires fault study for arc flash assessment.
          - name: Impact of Distributed Generation
            notes: |
              Adding DG increases fault levels:
              
              - **Synchronous generators:** Contribute 4-6× rated current
              - **Inverter-based (solar/wind):** Limited to 1.1-1.5× rated
              
              Existing equipment may become under-rated when DG added.
              
              **Re-assessment required** for any new generation connection.
          - name: Standards
            notes: |
              Key fault calculation standards:
              
              - **IEC 60909:** International standard, uses voltage factors
              - **IEEE C37 series:** North American practice
              - **ENA G74:** UK-specific for DG connections
              
              IPSA supports IEC 60909 and multiple other methods.

              **Sensitivity:** Detect all faults, even low-magnitude ones
              - Must see minimum fault current
              - Balance with security (avoid nuisance trips)

          Designing protection systems so that only the device nearest 
          the fault operates, minimizing the extent of the outage. 
          Time grading, current grading, and coordination principles.
        prerequisites:
          - power-system-fundamentals/protection-relays/Protection Relay Types
        outcomes:
          - Design coordinated protection schemes
          - Calculate coordination time intervals
          - Select appropriate IDMT curve characteristics
        concepts:
          - name: Discrimination Principle
            notes: |
              **Goal:** Only the device closest to the fault should operate.
              
              If fault at point F:
              ```
              Source ──[A]──[B]──[C]── F ──[Load]
              ```
              
              Relay C should trip first. If C fails, B backs up. If B fails, A backs up.
              
              Achieved through **time grading** and/or **current grading**.
          - name: Time Grading
            notes: |
              Upstream devices have progressively longer delays.
              
              **Coordination Time Interval (CTI):** 0.3 - 0.5 seconds
              
              Accounts for:
              - Breaker operating time (~50-80 ms)
              - Relay overshoot (~50 ms)
              - Safety margin (~100 ms)
              
              **Example:**
              - Relay C: 0.1s at max fault
              - Relay B: 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5s
              - Relay A: 0.5 + 0.4 = 0.9s
          - name: Current Grading
            notes: |
              Use fault current magnitude differences to discriminate.
              
              Fault current decreases with distance from source due to line impedance.
              
              Set instantaneous elements (50) to see only close-in faults:
              
              $$I_{pickup} > I_{fault,downstream}$$
              
              **Limitation:** Doesn't work well on short feeders or where fault current doesn't vary much.
          - name: Grading Margin Calculation
            notes: |
              For IDMT relays, check coordination at **maximum fault current** through both devices:
              
              1. Calculate downstream relay time at max fault
              2. Add CTI (0.3-0.5s)
              3. Calculate upstream TMS to achieve this time
              
              $$TMS_{upstream} = \frac{(t_{downstream} + CTI) \times ((I/I_s)^\alpha - 1)}{k}$$
          - name: Coordination Challenges
            notes: |
              **Parallel feeders:** Both see same fault current - need directional elements (67)
              
              **Ring networks:** Fault current from both directions - need directional or differential
              
              **DG infeed:** Changes fault current magnitude and direction
              
              **Motor contribution:** Adds to fault current, decays quickly

              Zones should **overlap at circuit breakers** to avoid blind spots.
              ```
              Zone A              Zone B
              |<────────────>|<────────────>|
              CT            CB            CT
              ```
              
              Fault at CB location seen by both zones - both may trip (acceptable for reliability).
          - name: Primary Protection
            notes: |
              First line of defense for a zone.
              
              **Characteristics:**
              - Fast operation (instantaneous or Zone 1)
              - Highly selective (only for internal faults)
              - Examples: Differential (87), Distance Zone 1 (21)
              
              Should clear ~90% of faults.
          - name: Backup Protection
            notes: |
              **Local backup:** Duplicate protection within same zone
              - Same speed and selectivity as primary
              - Protects against relay/CT failure
              - Example: Dual main protections
              
              **Remote backup:** Protection from adjacent zones
              - Slower (time-delayed)
              - Less selective (trips more than necessary)
              - Example: Distance Zone 2/3, time-graded overcurrent
          - name: Typical Protection Schemes
            notes: |
              | Equipment | Primary | Backup |
              |-----------|---------|--------|
              | Transmission line | Distance (21) | Distance Z2/Z3, OC |
              | Transformer | Differential (87T) | Overcurrent (51), REF |
              | Busbar | Differential (87B) | Breaker fail, remote |
              | Generator | Differential (87G) | Overcurrent, loss of excitation |
              | Motor | Thermal (49), Diff | Overcurrent (51) |
          - name: Breaker Failure Protection
            notes: |
              What if the breaker doesn't open?
              
              **Breaker Failure (50BF):**
              1. Trip signal sent to breaker
              2. Timer starts (typically 150-200ms)
              3. If fault current still flowing → trip all adjacent breakers
              
              Last resort backup - isolates larger area but prevents catastrophic failure.

              Impedance limits fault current and causes voltage drop.
              
              **Typical values:**
              - Distribution (11/0.4kV): 4-6%
              - Primary (33/11kV): 7-10%
              - Transmission (132/33kV): 10-15%
              
              **Fault current through transformer:**
              
              $$I_{fault} = \frac{100}{Z\%} \times I_{rated}$$

            notes: |
              Transformers in parallel must have:
              
              1. **Same vector group** (or compatible: Dy1 with Dy1)
              2. **Same voltage ratio** (within tap range)
              3. **Similar impedance** (within 10% for load sharing)
              
              Mismatched vector groups → circulating currents → overheating

            notes: |
              Field current controls reactive power output:
              
              **Over-excited:** High field current → exports Q → supports voltage
              
              **Under-excited:** Low field current → absorbs Q → may depress voltage
              
              **AVR (Automatic Voltage Regulator):**
              - Maintains terminal voltage setpoint

            notes: |
              Generator fault current decays over time:
              
              $$I''_f = \frac{E''}{X''_d}$$ (sub-transient, first few cycles)
              
              $$I'_f = \frac{E'}{X'_d}$$ (transient, up to ~2 seconds)
              
              $$I_f = \frac{E}{X_d}$$ (steady-state, if fault sustained)
              
              **Typical contribution:** 4-6× rated current initially

            notes: |
              Traditional networks designed for **one-way power flow**:

              Substation → Feeder → Loads
              (Voltage drops along feeder)
              ```
              
              With DG, power can flow **backwards**:
              ```
              Substation ← DG export
              (Voltage rises at DG location)
              ```

              **Key insight:** At LV, voltage rise mainly from **real power** export.
              
              Reactive power absorption has limited effect on LV voltage.

              **Islanding:** DG continues to energise a section of network that has been disconnected from the main grid.
              
              Can occur when:
              - Upstream breaker opens (fault, maintenance)
              - DG output matches local load (balanced island)

            notes: |
              **Safety:**

              - Risk to personnel working on "isolated" network
              - Public contact with downed conductors
              
              **Equipment:**
              - Poor power quality (voltage/frequency drift)
              - Out-of-phase reclosing (severe damage)
              - Fault clearance failure (no grid fault current)

              **Limitation:** May not detect balanced island (generation = load).
          - name: Active Detection Methods
            notes: |
              Inverter deliberately perturbs output to detect island:
              
              **Frequency shift:** Slight bias causes runaway if islanded
              
              **Reactive power variation:** Inject Q pulses, monitor V response
              
              **Impedance measurement:** Inject signal, measure grid impedance
              
              More reliable than passive methods but can interact between multiple inverters.

              - Curtail wind/solar
              - Intertrips (automatic post-fault)
              
              **Constraint costs:** £500M+ annually (growing with renewables)

              NESO forecasts demand to plan generation:
              
              **Timescales:**
              - Week ahead: Unit commitment
              - Day ahead: Final schedules
              - Intraday: Adjustments
              - Real-time: Balancing actions
              
              **Factors:**
              - Weather (temperature, wind, solar)
              - Time of day/week/year
              - TV pickups (kettles at half-time!)
              - Bank holidays
              - COVID showed how much patterns can change

            notes: |
              System operation becoming more complex:
              
              **Low inertia:**
              - Less synchronous generation
              - Faster frequency changes
              - Need for synthetic inertia from batteries/IBRs
              
              **Variable renewables:**
              - High instantaneous penetration (>70% at times)
              - Need for flexibility (storage, DSR, interconnectors)
              
              **Distributed resources:**
              - Millions of small generators/batteries
              - Visibility challenge for NESO
              - Local vs national balancing
