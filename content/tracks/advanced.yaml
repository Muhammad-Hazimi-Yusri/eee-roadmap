                Pulse Width Modulation creates an average voltage by rapidly switching between two levels. The duty cycle determines the average.

                ![PWM principle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Pwm.svg)

                ## Sinusoidal PWM (SPWM)

                For inverters producing AC, the duty cycle varies sinusoidally:

                $$D(t) = 0.5 + 0.5 \cdot m \cdot \sin(\omega t)$$

                Where $m$ is the modulation index (0 to 1).

                The fundamental output voltage:

                $$V_{1,rms} = \frac{m \cdot V_{dc}}{\sqrt{2}}$$

                ## Switching Frequency Selection

                Higher $f_{sw}$ advantages:
                - Harmonics pushed to higher frequencies (easier to filter)
                - Smaller filter inductors and capacitors

                Higher $f_{sw}$ disadvantages:
                - Higher switching losses
                - More EMI
                - Gate driver limitations

                Typical ranges: 10-100 kHz for motor drives, 100+ kHz for audio.

                ## Three-Phase PWM

                Three H-bridge legs with 120° phase-shifted modulation signals. Space Vector Modulation (SVM) is more efficient than simple SPWM for three-phase systems.

                ## Dead-Time Effects

                Dead-time causes output voltage distortion, especially at low currents where the distortion is a larger percentage of the fundamental. Compensation techniques exist in most modern motor drive ICs.

                **Synchronization** - connecting a generator to the grid requires matching voltage, frequency, phase, and sequence.

                **Four conditions for paralleling:**
                1. **Voltage magnitude**: Generator ≈ grid (within 5%)
                2. **Frequency**: Generator ≈ grid (within 0.1 Hz)
                3. **Phase angle**: In phase (0° difference)
                4. **Phase sequence**: Same rotation (ABC = ABC)

                **Synchronization methods:**

                **Manual (synchroscope):**
                - Pointer rotates: fast = frequency difference
                - Position = phase angle
                - Close breaker when pointer at 12 o'clock, moving slowly clockwise

                **Automatic synchronizer:**
                - Measures all parameters
                - Adjusts governor (frequency) and AVR (voltage)
                - Closes breaker at optimal moment

                **What happens if out of sync:**
                - Voltage mismatch: Circulating current (VAR flow)
                - Frequency mismatch: Hunting, potential instability
                - Phase mismatch: Severe current transient, mechanical shock
                - Wrong sequence: Catastrophic - effectively shorting phases

                **Synch check relay (25)**: Prevents breaker closure unless conditions met. Critical protection for generator and grid.
