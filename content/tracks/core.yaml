                Magnitude comparators determine the relationship between two binary
                numbers: A > B, A = B, or A < B.

                **1-Bit Comparator:**

                $$A > B: A\bar{B}$$
                $$A = B: \overline{A \oplus B} = A \odot B$$
                $$A < B: \bar{A}B$$

                **n-Bit Comparator:**
                Compare bit-by-bit from MSB to LSB. First unequal bit determines result.

                ![Magnitude comparator](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Parallel_Magnitude_Comparator.svg)

                **Cascading Comparators:**
                For wider comparisons, chain comparator ICs (like 74HC85).
                Each stage has A>B, A=B, A<B inputs from the previous stage.

                ![4-bit comparator extension](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/4_bit_magnitude_comparator_extension.svg)

                **Equality Comparator (Simpler):**
                Just check if A XOR B = 0 for each bit position, then AND all results.

                $$A = B: \prod_{i=0}^{n-1}(A_i \odot B_i)$$

                **Applications:**
                - Address matching in networking
                - Branch conditions in CPUs
                - Window comparators (range checking)

                Registers are groups of flip-flops that store multi-bit values.
                They can load, hold, or shift data.

                **Parallel Load Register:**
                All bits loaded simultaneously on clock edge when LOAD=1.

                **Shift Register:**
                Data shifts one position per clock cycle.

                ![Shift register](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/3_bit_universal_shift_register.svg)

                **Shift Register Types:**
                - **SISO:** Serial In, Serial Out — delay line
                - **SIPO:** Serial In, Parallel Out — serial to parallel converter
                - **PISO:** Parallel In, Serial Out — parallel to serial converter
                - **PIPO:** Parallel In, Parallel Out — standard register

                ![Bidirectional shift register](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/3_bit_bi-directional_shift_register_circuit.svg)

                **Universal Shift Register:**
                Can shift left, shift right, parallel load, or hold.
                Mode select inputs choose the operation.

                **Applications:**
                - Serial communication (UART)
                - LED displays (driving many LEDs with few pins)
                - Pseudo-random number generators (LFSR)
                - Digital delay lines

                **Ring Counter:**
                Shift register with output fed back to input.
                Circulates a single 1 (or 0) through the stages.

        title: Laplace & Z-Transform

        prerequisites:

                The transfer function $H(s)$ or $H(z)$ is the Laplace/Z-transform
                of the impulse response. It completely characterizes an LTI system.

                **Laplace Transform:**

                $$X(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} x(t)e^{-st} \, dt$$

                where $s = \sigma + j\omega$ is a complex frequency.

                **Transfer Function Definition:**

                $$H(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}$$

                **From Differential Equations:**
                For $\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 3\frac{dy}{dt} + 2y = x(t)$:

                $$s^2Y(s) + 3sY(s) + 2Y(s) = X(s)$$

                $$H(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{X(s)} = \frac{1}{s^2 + 3s + 2}$$

                **Standard Form:**

                $$H(s) = K\frac{(s-z_1)(s-z_2)...(s-z_m)}{(s-p_1)(s-p_2)...(s-p_n)}$$

                A system is BIBO (bounded-input, bounded-output) stable if every
                bounded input produces a bounded output.

                **Continuous-Time Stability:**
                All poles must be in the left half-plane (LHP):

                $$\text{Re}(p_i) < 0 \text{ for all poles } p_i$$

                **Discrete-Time Stability:**
                All poles must be inside the unit circle:

                $$|p_i| < 1 \text{ for all poles } p_i$$

                **Stability Tests:**
                - **Routh-Hurwitz:** Algebraic test for CT systems
                - **Jury Test:** Algebraic test for DT systems
                - **Nyquist Criterion:** Graphical, handles feedback

                **Marginal Stability:**
                Poles on the boundary (jω-axis or unit circle) give sustained
                oscillations — theoretically stable but practically risky.

                **Common Stable Systems:**
                - Low-pass filters (poles in LHP)
                - Most physical systems without positive feedback
