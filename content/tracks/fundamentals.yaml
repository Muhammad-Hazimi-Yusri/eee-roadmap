                Power factor measures how effectively a load converts current into useful work.

                **AC Power Types**

                | Power | Symbol | Unit | Formula |
                |-------|--------|------|---------|
                | Real (Active) | P | Watts (W) | $P = VI\cos\phi$ |
                | Reactive | Q | VAR | $Q = VI\sin\phi$ |
                | Apparent | S | VA | $S = VI$ |

                **The Power Triangle**

                ![Power triangle](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Power_Triangle_01.svg)

                $$S^2 = P^2 + Q^2$$

                $$\boxed{S = P + jQ}$$

                **Power Factor**

                $$\boxed{PF = \cos\phi = \frac{P}{S}}$$

                where $\phi$ is the angle between voltage and current.

                - $PF = 1$: Purely resistive (ideal)
                - $PF < 1$ lagging: Inductive load (most motors)
                - $PF < 1$ leading: Capacitive load

                **Why Power Factor Matters**

                Low PF means:
                - Higher current for same real power
                - Larger wires needed
                - More losses ($I^2R$)
                - Utility penalties for industrial customers

                **Power Factor Correction**

                Add capacitors in parallel with inductive loads to cancel reactive power:

                $$C = \frac{Q_{correction}}{\omega V^2}$$

                Target: $PF \geq 0.95$ for most industrial applications.
